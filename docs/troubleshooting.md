# Troubleshooting

## How to resolve problem of high memory usage on devtools?

You may have got a problem when you often reload JS, devtools process takes your RAM even more than 1G, it does not seem to clean.

In case of using [official remote debugger](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging.html#chrome-developer-tools), tested a initial project with remote debugging mode on Chrome 62 (beta), continuous reload JS 30 times:

Fortunately, the current versions of RNDebugger (Chromium 58) is better than Chrome (maybe >= 59?), but it still has a amount of growth:

To avoid similar problems in the future, there is a way to restart the Chrome devtools (macOS: `CMD+OPTION+I`, Linux/Windows: `CTRL+ALT+I`), the same applies to official remote debugger on Chrome.

## [iOS] Debugger can't load bundle when I use real device

If you're getting the following error:

It may caused by [`xip.io`](http://xip.io) service (RN use it for debug on real device), it lead your machine IP doesn't resolved sometimes. It's [enabled by default](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/ca9202f2385354b7a6b4d818ceb46bd96a037a7b/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh#L94), you can disable it in RN custom script on Xcode if you sure you don't need the service:

## React Inspector get stuck at "Connecting to Reactâ€¦" for RN ^0.43 ([#45](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/issues/45))

It usually on Android, the problem is related to `requestIdleCallback` API (try to check if it not work on debug mode).

This issue have been fixed in `react-devtools-core@^2.3.0`, please ensure the version is correct in your React Native project (Note that it's dependency of `react-native`).

Also, sometimes it have timer problem between host machine and device (emulator), you need make sure `date & time` setting is correct:

Or try to restart your device (emulator).

## Console thrown a lot of errors when I use React Inspector on Android

If you're experiencing the issue like [this comment of #84](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/issues/84#issuecomment-304611817), this issue have been fixed in `react-devtools-core@^2.3.0`, please ensure the version is correct in your React Native project (Note that it's dependency of `react-native`).
