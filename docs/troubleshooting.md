# Troubleshooting

## React Inspector get stuck at "Connecting to Reactâ€¦" ([#45](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/issues/45))

It usually on Android, maybe the problem is related to `requestIdleCallback` API (try to check if it not work on debug mode), make sure the device time is the same as the host (your computer), otherwise you can add the following code in front of [setupDevtools.js#L17](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/dba133a29194e300e9a2e9e6753f9d4e3a13c194/Libraries/Core/Devtools/setupDevtools.js#L17):

```js
// Not recommended
if (__DEV__) {
  window.requestIdleCallback = null
  window.cancelIdleCallback = null
}
// Next line: const {connectToDevTools} = require('react-devtools-core');
```

[facebook/react-native#13116](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/13116) can solved this issue, you can just waiting for the PR merged or use the patch.
