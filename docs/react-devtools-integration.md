# React DevTools Integration

**_NOTE_** Supported React Native version is `>= 0.62`. Please downgrade RNDebugger version to `0.10` if you're using older versions of React Native.

The [React DevTools](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/debugging#react-developer-tools) is built by [`facebook/react/packages/react-devtools-core`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-devtools-core).

It will open a WebSocket server to waiting React Native connection. The connection is already included in React Native (see [`setUpReactDevTools.js`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.62-stable/Libraries/Core/setUpReactDevTools.js)), it will keep trying to connect the React DevTools server in development mode, it should work well without any specification.

We made the server listen to a random port and inject `window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_PORT__` global variable in debugger worker.

For Android, we have the built-in `adb` util and it will reverse the port automatically.
